Action Potential Terrain Solar Module (APT-SM)
===============================================

Author: [Your Name]
Date of Public Release: [Fill in the date you publish]

Overview:
---------
The APT-SM is a novel photovoltaic architecture that mimics neural excitation behavior to propagate photonic energy laterally across a terrain-encoded surface. Unlike traditional solar cells which rely on vertical carrier extraction, this system introduces cascading excitation logic inspired by action potentials in neurons.

Key Features:
-------------
- Terrain-based logic encoding
- Lateral excitation and conduction pathways
- Threshold-controlled Logical Terrain Units (LTUs)
- Photonic cascade amplification
- Modular, stackable, and fabrication-flexible design

Installation / Usage:
---------------------
This is a physical photovoltaic design and not software. However, for simulations or integrations:
- Use terrain logic schematics with standard SPICE or PV modeling tools
